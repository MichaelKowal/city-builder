# city-builder

Simple city builder game built with THREE.js based on [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtzt35QOXmkJ9unmoeA5gXHcscQHJVQpW) by [Coffee Code Create](https://www.youtube.com/@coffeecodecreate) on YouTube.

The project has been fully migrated to Typescript and React. Vite is used to bundle the app and as a local dev server. Yarn Berry is used as a package manager.

To run the app simply download the repo, install the packages with `yarn`, then run `yarn start`. The app will run at the default Vite port of `localhost:5173`.

## TODO:

- Add Tests
- Performance Optimization
- Add more building types
